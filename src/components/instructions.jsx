      <p>
        The dataset we work with contains information about houses in the
        Netherlands and their sales prices. An AI was trained on this dataset to
        predict the sales price based on lot size in square feet, street type,
        construction date, first floor square feet, second floor square feet,
        number of full bathrooms, number of bedrooms, number of rooms, number of
        fireplaces, building type, and central airconditioning. In this
        experiment you will go through three phases, each with its own
        instructions. Please read the instructions for each phase carefully.
